        <h3>Our starting point</h3>
        <p>
            Modern buildings depend heavily on artificial lighting, even during
            daylight hours. While efficient LEDs have improved energy usage,
            they still replace something fundamental—natural sunlight.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aathpa was formed to explore a simple question:
            <strong>Can we use the sun itself as a primary daytime light source?</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>Our approach</h3>
        <p>
            Instead of converting sunlight into electricity and back into light,
            we focus on guiding sunlight directly into buildings using optical fiber.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aim is not to replace artificial lighting entirely, but to reduce
            its daytime dependence while improving indoor light quality.

        <h3>Current stage</h3>
        <p>
            Aathpa Lighting Solutions is currently in the prototype and testing phase.
            We are refining system design, performance, and integration methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe early collaboration with architects and builders leads to
            better solutions.
